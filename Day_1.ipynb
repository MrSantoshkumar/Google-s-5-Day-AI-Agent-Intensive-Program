It aims to make agent development more akin to traditional software development, offering developers precise control over agent behavior, orchestration, and tool usage. ADK is optimized for the Google ecosystem, particularly with Gemini models and Vertex AI, but it is designed to be model-agnostic and compatible with other frameworks.\n\nThe SDK is available in the following programming languages:\n*   **Python**\n*   **Java**\n*   **Go**\n",
